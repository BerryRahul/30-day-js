## Future Features 
A couple things I would want to add is 
* video players work with keyboard commands, spacebar/k pause the video, arrow keys skip through the video, f key makes the video fullscreen etc... 
* Implement a full screen button 
* Possible being able to choose a video to play 
* displaying the current volume/playback speed as text
