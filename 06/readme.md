Notes for day 6 
* when fetching from a json to an array convert it from a promise to a .json then push it into 
the array using the spread operator to avoid nesting
* to find matches to an input, filter the array by using the regex operation 'g' which is global so it will search the entire string if it matches your input 'bos' => 'boston'
* As well as 'i' for inclusive to avoid uppercase and lowercase specificity
