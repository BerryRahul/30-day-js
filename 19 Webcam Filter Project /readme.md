## How to Run 

* This requires browser permissions so a secure origin is required (local host/https)

* This application utilizes NodeJS secure servers 

1. After Files are installed run "npm install" in the terminal. Make sure you are in the working directory with the installed files

2. Then run "npm start" which will run the application as intended
