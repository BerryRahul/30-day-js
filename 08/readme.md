Day 8 Canvas Project with js 

* This project uses ctx to let you draw on the page while keeping track of your (x, y) and offset(x,y)

* Right now this has random strokes and colours for your drawings but in the future implement a full ms paint type canvas where you can choose the colour, size of the stroke and erase drawings as well, as well as a button to reset the drawing and save the current drawing to your computer
